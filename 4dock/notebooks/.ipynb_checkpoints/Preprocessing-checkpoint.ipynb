    "1. Phase Encoding POLARity (PEPOLAR) techniques (also called blip-up/blip-down): acquire at least two images with varying PE directions. Hence, the realization of distortion is different between the different acquisitions. The displacements map 𝑑PE(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) is estimated with an image registration process between the different PE acquisitions, regularized by the readout time 𝑇ro. Corresponds to 8.9.4 of BIDS.  \n",
