    "1. Phase Encoding POLARity (PEPOLAR) techniques (also called blip-up/blip-down): acquire at least two images with varying PE directions. Hence, the realization of distortion is different between the different acquisitions. The displacements map 𝑑PE(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) is estimated with an image registration process between the different PE acquisitions, regularized by the readout time 𝑇ro. Corresponds to 8.9.4 of BIDS.  \n",
    " - Translation: You have two EPI (functional images) in different phase encoding directions. Compare the two directions and see where it is different.\n",
    "2. Direct B0 mapping sequences: some sequences (such as SE) are able to measure the fieldmap Δ𝐵0(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧) directly. Corresponds to section 8.9.3 of BIDS. \n",
    " - Translation: Measure the field map directly with a higher order shim. (This is then applied to all your other images and you avoid having to re-shim before each EPI). FMRIPREP takes the image and then masks it with the magnitude image (thus why the skull strip is so important)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Phase-difference B0 estimation: to estimate the fieldmap Δ𝐵0(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧), these methods measure the phase evolution in time between two close GRE acquisitions. Corresponds to the sections 8.9.1 and 8.9.2 of the BIDS specification.  \n",
    " - Translation: Take two back to back gradient echo sequences and compare the phase drift.  You find the GRE in the T2* images. More (and better) explanation here http://mriquestions.com/gradient-echo.html\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fieldmap-less estimation (experimental): FMRIPREP now experimentally supports displacement field estimation in the absence of fieldmaps via nonlinear registration.  \n",
    " - This is honestly what blew me away with fMRIPREP. The experimental fieldmap estimation does an astonishingly good job. This is using FNIRT (non-linear estimation) to correct for articfacts. We will touch back on this in the registration topic\n",
